# Atomic Habits
Based around **Massive action vs small improvements** This is the case where daily it is easier to set daily small habits rather then large changes and improvements.

Forget about goal following and focus on creating a system around the goal. This is something we can plan around. Creates a Win/Lose system where you either achieve something or you don't. A system ensures you don't follow to a point and then stop after the goal. Focus on daily decisions.

## High Level
**Outcomes**: The result and what you achieve at the end of the process
