# Atomic Habits
Based around **Massive action vs small improvements** This is the case where daily it is easier to set daily small habits rather then large changes and improvements.

Forget about goal following and focus on creating a system around the goal. This is something we can plan around. Creates a Win/Lose system where you either achieve something or you don't. A system ensures you don't follow to a point and then stop after the goal. Focus on daily decisions.

## High Level
**Outcomes**: The result and what you achieve at the end of the process
**Process:** The way about which you setout daily to achieve goals and work towards something
**Identity**: The way you persieve yourself and how you act. When something you want in life is a part of your identity it isn't a chore it is a part of you. 

### Habit Loop
Cue, Craving, Response, Reward

## LAW 1: Make it Obvious
have habits as visible in your mind, we want to understand what we have going on in our life. 
Use Habit Scorecards to make it obvious the current habits you have in your life. 
Use Specific intentions that don't allow you to get away with not doing something: 
	"I will {Behaviour} at {time} in {this Location}"
Stacking Habits is a good way to ensure habits stick
Design you environment around you such as making good habits more obvious and bad less obvious

## LAW 2: Make it attractive
this links to dopamine heavily and we need to ensure we make things attractive or less attractive.
You can utilise Temptation bundling to make sure that you achieve something with a reward. 
The people we are around alter what we do massively so to build a good habit is to find the people that will do this with you. 
Highlight the benefits of a good habit rather then the bad this makes it more attractive. Vice versa for bad habits

## LAW 3: Make it Easy
Habits take repetitions to stick so rather then days look at repetition
Reduce the friction to allow a habit to stick Prime your environment for the habit to stick
Use the 2 minute rule by finding the 2 minute version of a habit.
Only aim to achieve this 2 minutes of the habit 
Reward yourself for the small things and count how well you do. 
This makes it visual and rewarding
