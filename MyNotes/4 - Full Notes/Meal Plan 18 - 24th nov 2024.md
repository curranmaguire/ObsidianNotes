### Nutrition
looking to hit 2-3g protein per kg which is 228-342g every day
breakfast is 70g
meat is ~100g protein for each 500g
so we want to be having 1kg of meat a day which becomes 14kg purchased per week which is £100 on meat alone a week which we can't do
this is too expensive but to hit the 228g goal we would only need 800g of meat a day which becomes 11kg a week so we have £80 a week on meat. this does mean I'll have to cook 1.6KG of meat a day however we could do 2kg batches which would be 6 days a week of braising and that can be really easy to do as I can put stuff on to braise and not braise stuff on Saturday's and try get extra amounts on days off. 
if we do 8.5kg of meat which is £60 a week we can then cook 2kg of meat 4 times a week so 4 different types and then that brings cost to £60 and brings cooking down as well as reaching close to the minimum protein tolerance. 

we can then follow doobydoobap and make an oven sauce base for each item that can be a tomato base that can be frozen or just stored as it takes an hour to make. 

following this we can create a base meal prep list that we get on
