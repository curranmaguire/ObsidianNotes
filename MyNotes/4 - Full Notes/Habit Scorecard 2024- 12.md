### Caveats
- the brushing teeth after the shower doesn't always happen but working on it with deoderant
- sometimes the TV isn't a bad thing I just need to make sure I don't abuse it like I do in the mornings which is why it is a 0

## PLAN

### Flaws

- need to solidify some places such as my morning routine, the phone in the bed isn't a good thing
- not getting enough water in throughout the day, due to not having a water bottle to hand that is definitely clean, need to make sure I clean the bottle weakly and daily
- Snuss is a big problem but not my biggest I need to cut down on it for sure but it isn't my worst problem

### Adaptations

- this month, Focus on my phone outside my bedroom that is my main goal this month
- secondary is water throughout the day to do this we will:
	- wash bottle every evening
	- leave my bottle on the side when I go to bed
	- drink two bottles at least a day
- Thirdly: go and do some work straight after breakfast
