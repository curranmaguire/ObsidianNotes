## Meal Prep Idea
1. create a pantry of flavours based around a cuisine such as asian, Mediterranean, Indian, etc.. 
2. each week braise your nutritional requirement of meat be it beef, pork, chicken 
3. store the braised meat and then cook up the veg and meat at the time you want to eat adding seasonings etc at meal times. 

## Initial Plan 
[[Meal Plan 18 - 24th nov 2024]]
