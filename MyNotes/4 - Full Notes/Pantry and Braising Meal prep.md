## Meal Prep Idea
1. create a pantry of flavours based around a cuisine such as asian, Mediterranean, Indian, etc.. 
2. each week braise your nutritional requirement of meat be it beef, pork, chicken 
3. store the braised meat and then cook up the veg and meat at the time you want to eat adding seasonings etc at meal times. 

## Initial Plan 
[[Meal Plan 18 - 24th nov 2024]]
looking to hit 2-3g protein per kg which is 228-342g every day
breakfast is 70g
meat is ~100g protein for each 500g
so we want to be having 1kg of meat a day which becomes 14kg purchased per week which is £100 on meat alone a week which we can't do
this is too expensive but to hit the 228g goal we would only need 800g of meat a day which becomes 11kg a week so we have £80 a week on meat. this does mean I'll have to cook 1.6KG of meat a day however we could do 2kg batches which would be 6 days a week of braising and that can be really easy to do as I can put stuff on to braise and not braise stuff on Saturday's and try get extra amounts on days off. 
if we do 8.5kg of meat which is £60 a week we can then cook 2kg of meat 4 times a week so 4 different types and then that brings cost to £60 and brings cooking down as well as reaching close to the minimum protein tolerance. 

we can then follow doobydoobap and make an oven sauce base for each item that can be a tomato base that can be frozen or just stored as it takes an hour to make. 

following this we can create a base meal prep list that we get each week and then use this as a kind of stocks and meats list for further items. 

for the shopping list we need 180g per meal per person so this becomes 5kg a week but with potatoes involved we have to use ~500g per person per meal so be weary 

to make an asian pantry we need to make sure these staples are always in the kitchen:
- sake
- mirin
- soy sauce
- sesame oil
- gochujang
- gochugaru
- miso
- kombu
- garlic and ginger

#### Key Takeaways
- 9kg of meat a week for two people
- 3-4 braising sessions a week
- 1 hour of sauce prep for the base tomato sauce or roasted veg
- should cost < £90 for a week of food
- potentially cost a bit more with the asian pantry staples but we shall see
