## Rugby Game - RWC Final (SA)

### Attack



### Defense
- tacklers seem to be rolling around to the inside and slowing the ball down bc carrier has to work harder to place open
- when going for a jackal vermulen hits the support and gets under them streight away 40:30


### Set Piece
##### Line-out
- GIMP with mirroring the spread and then aggressively giving them the front twin towers at the B and C
- outfield more man on but still prioritising B and C
- **The Gimp is lazy moving late and staying spread in-between he joins the lift quite late**
- Front Jumper is always moving then checking he seems to be going between hooker and jumper 32:07
- Retalik Really good mirror as you can see he's lazy and watching his options 36:50
##### Scrum



#### Summary
