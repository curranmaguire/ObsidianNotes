## How to Break Addiction

Keep in mind the dopamine response discussed in Hubermans dopamine lecture. we need to run away from easy dopamine hits and try and stay with long form slow releases of dopamine.

**Step 1: Self Awareness**
- Understand that you're addicted and be confident in your want to quit

**Step 2: Replace the crap source of dopamine**

**Step 3: Find an Obsession and create interests around this** 
- don't try and think about resisting the habit but think about something that makes you happy instead
**Step 4: Change your identity towards what you want to be and percieve yourself as this** 

**Step 5: Don't be too hard when you do relapse, acknowledge your success but also set a goal to prevent the relapse**
