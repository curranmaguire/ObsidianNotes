## Habit Plan 2024 - 10

Flaws:
- use of phone in the morning
- lack of productive habits such as shower, gym, eat, plan etc
- not many consistent behaviours 

Improvements:
- **(Phone)** Big focus on removing my phone habit in the morning and replacing it with getting up and showering
- **(Productive Habits)** create a habit ladder to have a productive start to my day
- **(Consistency)** create a routine for my day and schedule it
How:
- in the morning keep my phone on a towel and the rule is I can't use it for 1 minute in the morning. Easy Rule to follow and gets me thinking about my usage.
- the habit ladder will be:
	- wake up 
	- make bed
	- shower
	- get dressed
	- eat breakfast with the URC on
	- wash up my items
	- go to the gym
